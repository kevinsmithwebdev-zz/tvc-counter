This is a sample app for the [TriValley Coders](http://trivalleycoders.com/) meetup, a simple counter using Redux but no React.

It was created with create-react-app so it would be consistent with the other apps we're building in this group, but all React functionality have been removed from the app.

This is the "pre" version, a "functioning" app with all the Redux stripped out. The HTML and CSS are done, and the button clicks are handled in the JS (outputing to the console), but no logic is perfomed on those clicks - that is the Redux we will add.

Instructions on the step by step build are in the *instuctions* folder.
